# VSCode Integration

Visual Studio Code has an extension that enables integration with WSL.

Install the WSL extension for Visual Studio Code:

With this, you can open VSCode in "Linux" mode. That means you can open any folder from Windows and work with it in a Linux environment.

It's like VSCode was runing natively on Linux! Everything you do in this mode is inside WSL (open folders, create files, install extensions, modify settings, etc.)

Notice the _**"WSL Ubuntu-20.04 - Installed"**_ and _**"Local - Installed"**_ groups. The extensions installed on WSL will remain in WSL and not in Windows. Extensions installed on Windows are called "local".

You can open a folder from WSL directly in VSCode using the command:

```
code .
```
