# Configure

The first time you open Ubuntu, you will see this:

```
Installing, this may take a few minutes...

Please create a default UNIX user account.
The username does not need to match your Windows username.
For more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers

Enter new UNIX username:_
```

You need to input a username. It can be anything. I will put Bob.

```
Enter new UNIX username: bob

New password:_
```

Now, you need a password. It can be anything too, but **REMEMBER IT**. You will need this to use [`sudo`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] commands.

When everything is ready, you will see something like this:

```
bob@LAPTOP-9AB0OA0V:~$
```
