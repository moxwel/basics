This book is a personal knowledge base that I built through all my years learning programming languages and my university career.

I'd like to share with you what I've learned, and the way I learned it. I'm sure this will help many who want to learn new programming languages in the easiest and most understandable way possible.

## ðŸ““ About the repository

**"**[**basics**](https://github.com/moxwel/basics)**"** is the GitHub repository where I've started saving all my code notes about programming languages: syntax, execution, etc.

I just wanted to save the basic aspects of each programming language, so that if **someone wanted to start to learn it, it would be easier for them to get started**.

For this reason, don't expect too much advanced tutorials. Although there may still be advanced topics in some languages, I will try to introduce them as seamlessly as possible while you progress through the tutorials.

In any case, the main goal is to help you learn new programming languages and the differences between them, different approaches, and different thinking for each one.

_The start is here, the rest is your own exploration.  <mark style="background-color:green;">**Good luck!**</mark>_&#x20;
