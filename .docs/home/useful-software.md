# Useful Software

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code homepage

**A very simple yet powerful code editor**. You can install extensions to extend use and capabilities. You can turn this text editor to an entire IDE ([Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated\_development\_environment)).

If you want to use other text editor, you can search alternatives in [Alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/software/visual-studio-code/).

## WSL

WSL installation documentation
{% endembed %}

If you are on Windows, the **Windows Subsystem for Linux** will be a must. Is a very powerful tool that let you use a Linux environment inside Windows, seamlessly, almost like running two OS's at the same time.

With this, you get all the power of Linux, with the convenience of not to dual-boot or install virtual machines and things like that.

{% hint style="info" %}
WSL integrates well with **Visual Studio Code** and [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).
{% endhint %}

## Git

{% embed url="https://git-scm.com/" %}

{% endembed %}

You're going to have to use it sooner or later. A SCM software ([Source Code Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version\_control)) that helps you to **gain control over the changes you make (and your team) in your projects**.

Services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (and more) relays on this system for all their projects inside.

It will be a tutorial for Git too. Stay tuned!
