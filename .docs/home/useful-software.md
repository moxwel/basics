**A very simple yet powerful code editor**. Extremely customizable and you can install extensions to extend usage and capabilities. So powerful, you can turn this text editor to an entire IDE[^1] too.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to use other text editor, you can search alternatives in [Alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/software/visual-studio-code/).

## WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you are on Windows, the **Windows Subsystem for Linux** will be a must. Is a very powerful tool that let you use a Linux environment inside Windows, seamlessly, almost like running two OS's at the same time.

With this, you get all the power of Linux, with the convenience of not to dual-boot or install virtual machines and things like that.

If you want to install and configure WSL, check the guide below!

A very modern, customizable and feature rich command line terminal application.

It has support for tabs, rich text, custom colors, and integrates well with other system's utilities like WSL. Is the successor of CMD[^2], and if you are on Windows, you should use it (on Windows 11 it's already installed).

## Git

You're going to have to use it sooner or later. An SCM[^3] software that helps you to **gain control over the changes you (and your team) make in your project**.

Services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (and more) relays on this system for all their projects inside.

It will be a tutorial for Git too. Stay tuned!

{% hint style="info" %}
Git integrates well with [**Visual Studio Code**](useful-software.md#visual-studio-code).
