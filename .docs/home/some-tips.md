# Some tips

## _TRY_ every command

Even if it is the simplest "Hello World", just try it in your terminal.

At the same time while you're reading, open a terminal and put all the commands you see in the tutorials. The best way to learn is to do it yourself.

## _MODIFY_ every command

Don't just copy-paste the commands, modify them!

See with your own eyes what each thing does. Change variables, names, modify conditions, build your own code. Experimenting is the key to understanding.

## _BREAK_ the language

Don't be afraid about errors in your code.

Breaking the language gives you clues about how it works. Try every combination possible and every condition possible. The computer will tell you what's happening (usually).

## Ask "WHY?"

The nature of "programming" is generally very logical. Everything has its answer.

If something isn't working, stop, relax, and go step-by-step. Eventually you will find your answer.
