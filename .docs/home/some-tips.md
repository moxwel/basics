# Some tips

## &#x20;<mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">TRY</mark>  _ every command

Even if it is the simplest "Hello World", just try it in your terminal.

At the same time while you're reading, open a terminal and put all the commands you see in the tutorials. The best way to learn is to do it yourself.

## &#x20;_<mark style="background-color:blue;">MODIFY</mark>  _ every command

Don't just copy-paste the commands, modify them!

See with your own eyes what each thing does. Change variables, names, modify conditions, build your own code. Experimenting is the key to understanding.

## &#x20;_<mark style="background-color:red;">BREAK</mark>  _ the language

Don't be afraid about errors in your code.

Breaking the language gives you clues about how it works. Try every combination possible and every condition possible. The computer will tell you what's happening (usually).

## &#x20;<mark style="background-color:green;">ASK</mark> everything

The nature of "programming" is generally very logical. Everything has its answer.

If something isn't working, stop, relax, and go step-by-step. Ask yourself "Why this works?", "Why this doesn't work?", "Why this is like this?".

## &#x20;<mark style="background-color:purple;">SEARCH</mark> every term you don't know

In the programming and computing world there's so many terms, concepts, acronyms and more. If something appears and you don't know what it means, search it.

In this book, I will put [annotations like this](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] with links to definitions for common terms.

Heres one for example: OS[^2].

## &#x20;<mark style="background-color:orange;">READ</mark> carefully

This can apply to every aspect in life, but in programming and computing is very important.

Read, read and re-read every word in your screen. When problems occur, error messages can be very important in finding the solution. Don't fear the <mark style="color:red;">walls of red text</mark>, read it carefully and you might find the solution.

Also, when using software, read every button, every prompt, every message. The developers assume that if you read everything, you can learn how to use it perfectly (usually).

[^1]: Hello!

[^2]: Operating System
