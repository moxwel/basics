# LEARN.md

This repository is a personal knowledge base that I built through my years learning programming languages
and my university career.

I'd like to share with you what I've learned, and the way I learned it. I'm sure this will help many who
want to learn new programming languages in the easiest and most understandable way possible.

Originally, the articles I created here are in Spanish, but I'm translating it to English. Plus,
I want to move all these files to a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) page. This will make more
easy to read and more educational.
